             <h1>Rajen Puckree</h1>
                <p>Rajen Puckree is a South African coal miner, sexual assaulter and retiring businessman in the South African mining space.</p>
                <p>His full names are Rajendra Krishna Puckree and he resides in Bedfordview.</p> 
                
                <h3>Rajen Puckree has sexually assaulted various women and carries a gun.</h3>

                <p>Rajen Puckree can be defined as an obese man of Indian decent with a South African accent. He was born in the 1960's and has been mining coal in South Africa for several years.</p>
                <p>He has a wife and two children, and spends the majority of his time mining and assaulting unsuspecting women.</p>

                <h2>Does Rajen Puckree own Puckree Group?</h2>
                <p>Yes, Rajen Puckree owns various businesses including Puckree Group, Ngwenya Coal, Circle Way Trading, Bronze Starlight Trading, Ngwenya Mining and Exploration, Silver Meadow Trading, Bultfontein Coillery, Puckree Farming, and various other businesses that are currently being investgated for fraud.</p>
                <p>Rajen has admitted to accumulating large volumes of unaccounted-for prepayments that continue to circulate between his group of companies, thus causing the closure of various subsidiaries. Rajen has applied for residency in Mauritius and plans to relocate his family due to a vast number of failed business transactions that led to the accumulated debts.</p>

                <h2>Is Rajen Puckree a Rapist</h2>
                <p>Rajen Puckree has recently been accused of sexual assault, but the police station has closed the dockets after he opened various counter claims against the victims. The police admitted that this was not the first case against Rajen, and he has been involved in a large variety of cases that mysteriously closed down.</p>
                <p>His longstanding history with prostitutes and continuous exploitation of young women has led to the creation of this article, as the local police have failed to cooperate with many of the victims that were involved in exposing the criminal.</p>

                <h2>Rajen Puckree's struggle with Sex and Prostitution</h1>
                <p>Despite his age and obesity, Rajen continues to explore a rather taboo field of sexuality. Rajen primarily targets women between the ages of 16 and 32, falling part of the class of sexual predators that prefer younger women.</p>

                <h2>Why is he not in jail?</h1>
                <p>Wealth ensures that the wheels of justice turn slowly, when wealth can be used to bribe the cops.</p>

                <h2>Did Rajen Puckree bribe Bedfordview Police Station?</h1>
                <p>Rajen has been known to be involved with the local police station and carries a firearm. The Bedfordview police station is currently being investigated for bribery and corruption, but law enforcement is slow.</p>
                
                <h2>Does Rajen Puckree beat his Wife?</h2>
                <p>It can not be confirmed or denied whether Rajen Puckree's wife has suffered assault or whether she has stayed with him for their children, or for his money. It remains unclear why Rajen Puckree's wife continues to endure the constant infedelity, and whether she is involved in the rape, sexual assault and armed assault of various victims.</p>
