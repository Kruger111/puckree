        <h2>His Sexual Assault Victims</h2>
        <p>A recent victim reported that she was simply trying to do buisness with Rajen's company when he assumed that she would be providing sex in return for his issuance their payments. He insisted that she drinks and removes her clothes, but she refused.</p> 
        <p>Rajen refused to open his door once she was trapped, and forced himself onto her until she submitted, despite having been on her menstrual cycle at the time.</p>
        <p>She reported the presence of a loaded pistol, and confirmed that the police have mysteriously closed the case after he accused her of harrassment.</p>
        <p>Another victim was found - a 35 year old business woman that has been trying to work with Rajen for years. He initially started using vile language to describe her bodyparts, and before he even got the chance, she managed to escape with her dignity in tact.</p>
        <p>Both victims opened cases against Rajen after which he opened counter claims for horrific criminal acts, in order to discredit the victims and convince the police that it was all just "another crazy lady that wants his money".</p>

        <h2>Rajen Puckree's Prositutes Speak Out</h2>
        <p>We have recently consulted with 4 female escorts that have been hire by Rajen Puckree. "He was animalistic and aggressive" - reported one of the anonymous escorts. "I am not used to men like him. It's like he wanted to degrade me".</p>
        <p>After thorough investigation, we found another 2 young white women that have been hired by Rajen, from the same agency, that shared similar reports. "He wanted me to give him a blowjob and when I refused, he pushed my face down-" said the 24 year old girl from Bedfordview.</p>

        <h2>Rajen Puckree's Children</h2>
        <p>While the frequent visits to younger women have become a habit to Rajen, the victims have become afraid for their wellbeing as they fear he might be inappropriately interacting with his children and may not be fit to be in their close vicinity.</p>
        
        <h2>His Wife Vinosha</h2>
        <p>Needless to say, the dangers of the use of prostitution inevitably include high risk exposure to STD's such as HIV/AIDS. In the case where Rajen is still continuing sexual intercourse with his wife, it is unlikely that she is safe from the natural end results of his extramarital affairs.</p>

        <h2>Puckree Group</h2>
        <p>It is unclear whether Rajen has taken similar actions against his employees at his company, Puckree Group, or if this is a side of himself that he hides. But the truth is clear - Rajen Puckree is a threat to society and should be behind bars.</p>

        <h2>Proof of Allegations</h2>
        <p>While the dockets have been closed, the South African police database still contain various records of Rajen Puckree's list of assault cases and counter-claims. The list is publicly available when doing further inspections.</p>

        <h2>Recourse</h2>
        <p>The victims have pursued legal action against Puckree, however, he has made various cases disappear. This site, and various others related to Rajen, have been established as a non-profit, to warn the public of his brutal activities, while Rajen is still on the loose in Bedfordview.</p>
