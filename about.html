        <p>Rajen Puckree has been accused of money laundering, and has been seen with large amounts of cash in his possession, but managed to escape without criminal conviction. He has also been linked to various companies that have been investigated for fraud and criminal activity. Various South African miners have recently been caught with money laundering and the widespread problem remains undealt with. Although various cases around Rajen have disappeared, he is currently being investigated for money laundering and has often been found to pay his workers in cash after "mining services" have been completed, but has 4 stillstanding mines that are no longer operational.</p>

        <h2>How Rajen Puckree usually attacks Victims</h2>
        <p>Rajen is known to make his victims drink alcohol before asserting himself over them. He uses the drink as a tool to "soften the battlefield" and make the victim unconscious. More can be found on the sexual assault / victims page</p>

        <p>Rajen Puckree is based in Bedfordview, South Africa. His business premises is located at 45 Arbroath Road, Bedfordview, 2007. The exact locations of his mines and business offices are often kept confidential, but they are known to be in the vicinity of Johannesburg.</p>

        <h2>Does Rajen only attack and hire Women?</h2>
        <p>It is unclear whether Rajen only hires women for prostitution, but he has taken part in a threesome with one of the reporting victims that we are in contact with.</p>
        
        <h2>Are Rajen's Sexcapades normal for a 60 year old Male?</h2>
        <p>Sex addiction is common amongst overweight men, whom have become able to evoke interest in their wifes. However, a recent study has revealed that over 2% of men in South Africa have raped, assaulted or uncomfortably engaged in sex with otherwise unwilling women. This makes Rajen part of a predatory minority group, focused on attacks against women.</p>
