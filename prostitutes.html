        <h2>Why Rajen Puckree uses Escorts</h2>
        <p>While overweight men often have difficulty with sex and self control, this may not the reason why Rajen makes use of sex workers. The South African mine owners associations often celebrate around such activities, and freely make use of escorts to entertain their international clients. Puckree's use of sex workers may be the result of societal conditioning, however, his physical and sexual abuse of non-sex workers remains alarming.</p>

        <h2>Gun Violence</h2>
        <p>While many mine owning gangsters like Rajen have made use of guns to intimidate victims, it remains a cultural issue that the Bedfordview police station is failing to address. In Rajen's recent attempt to threaten a young woman with a gun while in his private getaway home, she escaped with her dignity barely in tact. The rules of guns are pretty simple, you will either shoot or be shot. The question remains, why did Rajen carry a firearm around an unarmed young woman?</p>

        <h2>Are Escorts Generally Safe with Rajen</h2>
        <p>While some escorts have reported unwanted mistreatment, aggression and unwanted persistence, others have simply commented that "he was fine". As we continue to look for and collaborate with the groups that organize escorts in Bedfordview, we will be gathering more information and posting it here.</p>
        
        <h2>The widespred Problem</h2>
        <p>In many countries, prostitution has been legalized. The problem of prostitution is a widespread economic problem that is caused by poverty, abuse, and poor mental health. Over 12% of men admit to having made use of sex workers to appease their cravings.</p>
