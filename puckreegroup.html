        <h2>Puckree Group</h2>
        <p>The Puckree Group, based in Bedfordview, South Africa, is involved in coal mining, exploration, and development. Puckree Group focuses on "responsible mining practices" and have worked on several projects, including Witrand and Bultfontein mines that have downsized in operational scale. The company has also acquired prospecting rights for future developments and will continue to remain subject to the owner, Rajen Puckree, for the years to come - unless he goes to jail. Puckree Group has emphasized that they will focus on mining and rehabilitation efforts, while some of their mines remain unrehabilitated and others are illegally consuming electricity that belongs to the surrounding mines.</p>

        <h2>Puckree Group's Misconduct</h2>
        <p>A community leader, Thembinkosi Skhosana, alleged that the Puckree Group was involved in corruption and non-compliance at Steve Tshwete Municipality. He claimed that local officials benefited from projects that did not serve the community. In response, municipal councillor Edward Mnyambi and Puckree Group CLO Pandie Magudumela addressed these allegations in a discussion on Ikwekwezi FM, but failed to provide any concrete evidence at all.</p>

        <h2>Who owns Puckree Group</h2>
        <p>Puckree Group is 100% self-funded by Rajen Puckree, and his wife Vinosha Puckree whom is a GP (doctor) and a director of the organization. The company is registered under enterprise number M2006033166 and has been in business since 2006.</p>
        
        <h2>What does Puckree Group do?</h2>
        <p>They primarily operate in the coal resource sector, focusing on projects such as Witrand, Bultfontein, and Vaalbank mines. The Puckree Group describes itself as a well-capitalized, experienced, and committed emerging South African mining corporate, aiming for long-term sustainability in the industry, while the owner, Rajen Puckree, is off collecting prepayments for unmined coal, and sexually assaulting women whenever he gets a moment.</p>

        <h2>Secrecy</h2>
        <p>Most companies around the size of Rajen Puckree's usually go public, however, with the sheer volume of skeletons in the closet, Puckree Group may not be going public, ever. While Puckree Group primarily keeps its financial records and majority of its business dealings private, it sure makes sense why a company with so many assets would choose to remain secretive about its shady underdealings.</p>

        <h2>Did Rajen Puckree corrupt Puckree Group?</h2>
        <p>While there are no serious records of any cases against Puckree Group, there is strong reason to believe that these records have been wiped under the rug with intent. Most businesses experience at least one lawsuit every two years. Having seen zero records of Puckree's apparently "clean business dealings" raises concerns over whether the business is truly clean - especially with such a violent person as Rajen Puckree in control.</p>

        <h2>Money Laundering</h2>
        <p>While various charges of money laundering have been dropped before they even hit the court's doors, Rajen is currently being investigated for money laundering through his mining ventures including Puckree Group. While nothing has been confirmed yet, he has been seen with large amounts of cash and regularly pays his staff in printed bank notes. Our sources have confirmed that Rajen is not a fiduciary director of Puckree Group.</p>

        <h2>What is the future of Puckree Group?</h2>
        <p>While Puckree Group has been involved in various projects, the future remains uncertain. The company has faced challenges in maintaining its operations and has been subject to scrutiny over its practices. The ongoing investigations into Rajen Puckree's personal activities may further impact the company's reputation and operations.</p>
